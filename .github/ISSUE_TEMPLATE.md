<!-- This issue tracker is only for technical issues related to Neon Core.

General neon questions and/or support requests and are best directed to the [neontalk.io forums](https://neontalk.io/).

For reporting security issues, please contact the Neon developers on the #neon-dev Freenode IRC channel or alternatively you can email us at info@litecoinca.sh.

If the node is "stuck" during sync or giving "block checksum mismatch" errors, please ensure your hardware is stable by running memtest and observe CPU temperature with a load-test tool such as linpack before creating an issue! -->

<!-- What version of Neon Core are you using, where did you get it (website, self-compiled, etc)? -->
